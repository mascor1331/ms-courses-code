In this paper, authors propose a new method TILT (transform invariant low-rank textures) to come up with significant low rank textures from 2D images of 3D environment. Finding these low rank textures help captures effective geometric patterns in data found in everyday object recognition tasks. The authors address shortcomings of locality dependent current methods which inherently are sensitive to local image variations and needs pre-processing, hence prevents these methods from taking a larger regions in account to detect symmetrical patterns. The basic idea of the approach is to view each image as a matrix and find low-rank matrix lending transformation subject to sparse errors. However, the cost function is highly non-convex and discontinuous, and the equality constraint is highly non-linear. Thus, calculating TILT would be computationally hard, therefore authors leverage recent breakthroughs in convex optimization by using the sum of singular values, L1 norm and iteratively solving the non-linear constraint problem along with some constraints to avoid converging to a local minima. This enables robust recovery of a  high-dimensional low-rank matrix despite gross sparse errors, experiments show this work well in facial or textual forms which are approximately low-rank in formation. TILT outshines in effectively recovering project deforms and domain transforms even in case of occlusions or noise and is able to rectify not only small local features such as an edge and a corner but also large global symmetric patterns such as an entire facade of a building.
