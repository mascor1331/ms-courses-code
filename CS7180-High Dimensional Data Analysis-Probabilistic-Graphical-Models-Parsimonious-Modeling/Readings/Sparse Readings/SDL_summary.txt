The paper proposes a novel discriminative formulation for sparse representation of images using learned dictionaries. The authors extend the previous work in the literature on sparse representation done on either predefined operators or learned dictionaries for reconstructive, discriminative, or generative models proven good in areas such as such as denoising and texture classification. They proposed a framework for learning simultaneously a single shared dictionary as well as multiclass sparse models in mixed generative and discriminative models and to let multiple classes share some features and use the sparse representations coefficientsas a part of classification. Including generative modeling helps with robustness while the discriminative helps accurately fit the best parameters that will predict the labels of the data. All models (generative, discriminative, linear and bilinear) are then compared with reconstructive approach in digit and texture recognition which shows the proposed techniques are better compared to state-of-art methods.
