COURSE   : CS 5600 - Computer Systems Fall 2016
TITLE    : Homework 2 - File System Implementation
TEAM     : team-05-hw2
MEMBERS  : Evan and Ayush
DEADLINE : Nov. 25, 2016

PROGRESS:
1. Added translate function to translate a path into the inode number of the 
destination.
2. Added fs_getattr function to get file or directory attributes.
3. Added "todo" print statements in each of the functions as an aid to help 
identify what function(s) need to be written in order for certain commands 
to work.
4. Halfway through with fs_readdir function to get directory contents which 
would enable read-only command line access to fsx600 images.
5. Created backlog of tasks on Trello, 
test & debug would be picked up on fs_readdir is completed.

WORKFLOW:
1. Never commit to master, each of us would fork the master branch, make our
own changes locally and create a Pull Request which would be merged only after
code is reviewed thoroughly by the other team mate, enforcing a strong
collaborative code evaluation system.
2. Create issues on github with any wall we hit on a module so other could
look at it and comment with a plausible solution.
2. Trello Board to keep track of our work progress on a weekly basis.
3. On class days, we plan on meeting up an hour before class to discuss ideas
and questions that could not be answered online.
