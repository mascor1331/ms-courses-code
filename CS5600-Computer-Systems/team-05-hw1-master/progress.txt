TEAM NAME: team-05-hw1
MEMBERS  : Evan and Ayush
DEADLINE : Oct. 11, 2016

PROGRESS:
1. Completed Q1 from Homework on Thursday, Sep 22 2016.
2. Brainstormed on the context of the problem and drafted our approach towards
solving the problem in a timely and efficient manner.
3. After going through the problems we've decided to split the work due to the
seperation of concerns here on the rest of questions since each of them fall
under different category and can be done individually.
4. Started working on Q2 and Q3.

WORKFLOW:
1. Never commit to master, each of us would fork the master branch, make our
own changes locally and create a Pull Request which would be merged only after
code is reviewed thoroughly by the other team mate, enforcing a strong
collaborative code evaluation system.
2. Create issues on github with any wall we hit on a module so other could
look at it and comment with a plausible solution.
2. Trello Board to keep track of our work progress on a weekly basis.
3. On class days, we plan on meeting up an hour before class to discuss ideas
and questions that could not be answered online.
